# Efficient-Route-Management-For-emergency-response-vehicle-using-A-Algortihm

This project provides two main functionalities: visualizing a grid using images to represent different types of locations (e.g., buildings, streets) and implementing the A* pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest path in a grid. 

## Features

### Image-Based Grid Display
- Load and display images corresponding to grid elements.
- Customizable grid configuration.
- Visual representation of a grid using Matplotlib.

### A* Pathfinding Algorithm
- A* search algorithm to find the shortest path in a grid.
- Load grid data from a JSON file.
- Visual representation of the grid, start, goal, and path.
- Animation showing the step-by-step search process.
